The idea behind this project is to build a heads up display system similar to the one in the Ironman movies.

Feel free to join in on this project. Let's see if we can't make it a reality.

Currently using OpenGL 1.0 (because that's what I know at the moment) for all graphics.

See ToDoList.md for upcoming features.
